# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

*My true passion is DJing, although it was difficult to make a steady income at the start; this led me to become Lead Developer/Solution Architect at [@nexum](https://twitter.com/nexum).*

*Despite having several other passionsâ€”such as cycling, playing console games, drone pilotingâ€”I take solace in knowing that one day my dream of owning a Ford Mustang GT500 will come true!*

*My Packt book subscription helps keep me engaged throughout each day with its multitude of reading material.*

*Moreover, I am truly blessed to share my home with an incredibly lovable deaf kitty who lights up any room she enters!*
